# fly-perks-app

## Description

The ideia behind this application, in terms of businnes, is to create a software primarily focused on the backend, where we will have certan rules to award points to passengers based on their app usage.

The initial functionalities of the system will be:

[****Passenger Registration****](passenger_registration.md)

- Register flights.
- Sell flights to passengers
- Keep track of flight mileage for each passenger in a loyalty account.

### **Testing Pyramid**

As part of this project, we aim to explore the concept of the testing pyramid. The testing pyramid is a testing strategy that suggests having a balanced distribution of different types of tests. It consists of three layers:

1. **Unit Tests**: These tests are focused on testing individual components or units of code in isolation. They are typically fast, reliable, and help ensure the correctness of smaller units of functionality.
2. **Integration Tests**: Integration tests focus on verifying the interactions and integration between different components or services. They help identify issues that may arise due to the integration of multiple parts of the system.
3. **End-to-End Tests**: End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios and test the entire system from start to finish. They ensure that all components work together correctly and provide a high-level validation of the system's functionality.

By following the testing pyramid approach, we can establish a robust and efficient testing strategy that provides comprehensive test coverage while keeping test execution time and maintenance efforts manageable.

## **Possible Technologies Used**

This project may leverage the following technologies:

1. **Spring Boot 3**: A powerful and popular Java framework for building robust and scalable applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features to simplify the development process.
    - Reference: **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)**
2. **Java 17**: The latest version of the Java programming language, known for its performance, security, and reliability. It offers various enhancements and new features that improve developer productivity.
    - Reference: **[Java 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/)**
3. **Cucumber**: A testing framework that supports Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). It allows you to write tests in a natural language format and encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and stakeholders.
    - Reference: **[Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)**
4. **MySQL**: A widely used relational database management system known for its reliability and scalability. It provides robust data storage and retrieval capabilities for the application.
    - Reference: **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)**
5. **Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform that enables the building of real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It provides high throughput, fault-tolerant messaging capabilities, making it suitable for event-driven architectures.
    - Reference: **[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)**

## **Project Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to have fun while developing the application. We believe that technology can bring joy and excitement to our lives. As the saying goes, "In a world full of challenges, programming is our playground of fun!" So let's embrace the joy of coding and create something amazing together!
